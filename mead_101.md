# Mead Making 101
### This topic only covers the basics, to get started

## Things Needed
1. Honey (rec: Fireweed)
2. Water (rec: any spring water, I use Crystal Springs)
3. Yeast (see note in Phase 4):
    - For fermenting >65°F, Lalvin kv-1116
    - For fermenting >58°F but <65°F, Lalvin 71-b-1122
4. Go-Ferm
4. Nutrient (rec: Fermaid-0)
5. Campden Tablets (Potassium Metabisulfite)
6. Potassium Sorbate
7. 2 Carboys
    - Ideally ones with large "mouths" or openings
8. One or two airlocks
9. Hydrometer
10. StarSan Concentrate sanitizer
11. Distilled water (for diluting StarSan)
12. Spray Bottle
13. Temperature gauge
14. Large/tall mixing spoon
15. Small jar (rec: Mason jar, 16Oz), for mixing
16. Racking Cane
17. Super-kleer
18. Optionals:
    - Fruit (flavoring)
    - Spices (flavoring)

## How much stuff do I need?
- 2 grams of Yeast per gallon of Mead
    - It is OK to use an entire 5g packet on anything less than 2 gallons
- 1.25 grams of Go-Ferm per every gram of Yeast (2.5g per gallon of Mead)
- 3 Lbs of Honey per 1 gallon of Mead
    - You may also want up to an additional 1 lb per gallon to backsweeten
- 1 Gallon of water per gallon of Mead
- 3 grams of Fermaid-O per gallon of Mead
    - Note: If you choose a different nutrient, the needed amount may vary

#### If you've taken Jon Oppegaard's (https://www.opmead.com/) Mead Making class, Phases 1 through 3 cover what you learn "in class", and the remaining phases are what you complete at home

## Ok let's go make some mead
## Phase 1: Rehydrating the yeast (making the Yeast Culture)
1. Start to slowly heat the honey to ~100°F. This just helps with pouring and mixing.
    - I just submerge my honey conatiner(s) in warm water
2. Heat 2 oz of water **per gram of yeast** to roughly 104°F
3. In the mason jar, fully dissolve the Go-Ferm in the hot water
4. After the Go-Ferm is fully dissolved, sprinkle the yeast on top of the liquid
5. Gently swirl the mixture to mix in the yeast. It does not need to dissolve, it will sink on its own
6. Loosely cover the jar (do not seal it, pressure needs to escape) and set it aside
    - Check the time, or set a 20 minute timer
    - You will want this mixture to sit for at least 20 minutes before combining with the Must

## Phase 2: Equipment Cleaning/Prep
1. Mix distilled water and StarSan Concentrate, closely following the dilution instructions on the StarSan container
    - It is helpful to mix it in a spray bottle for ease of use
    - When made with distilled water, a batch should last several months in a sealed container
2. Spray anything that may come in contact with your mead with the diluted StarSan 
    - one of your carboys 
    - one airlock 
    - hydrometer 
    - stirring spoon
    - temperature gauge
    - etc.
3. Let everything drip (over a bucket or down a sink) until the liquid has run completely off
    - Any leftover foam will not hurt anything, including yourself
    - DO NOT rinse or wipe off

## Phase 3: Mixing the Must
### This is where you start making your own decisions. Following these steps closely will end up with potentially a 14% ABV Mead. Changing the amount of honey will change ABV, but most yeast will "max out" between 12 and 16% ABV -- exceeding 18% ABV is diffciult.
### Instructions assuming 1 gallon of Mead
1. Pour 3 lbs of honey into the carboy
2. Pour in 1 gallon of spring water
3. Vigorously mix the honey and water
    - There must be no "solid" honey left, it should be fully dissolved
    - The more you can agitate, the more oxygen you introduce to the mixture as well, which help the yeast in the very early stages
4. After mixing, insert your (sanitized) hydrometer to the mixture - it should read about 1.100
    - THis would be roughly a 14.2% ABV *potential* mead
5. If 20 or more minutes have passed since completing Phase 1 (Yeast Culture) AND the temperature difference between the Yeast Culture and the Must is less than 10°F, proceed
    - If the tempertaure delta is higher than 10°F, slowly raise one or the other to match. Never exceed 104°F.
6. Pour the entire container of Yeast Culture into the Must
7. Stir the resulting mixture well
8. Firmly attach the lid to the carboy
9. Attach the airlock to the lid

## Phase 4: Fermenting (patience)
### When talking about temperature, it is the temperature of the Must, not the room/ambient. The Must will likely be 2-5° above ambient. Choose your yeast based off of this - most yeast will produce off flavors at higher temperatures.
1. Place the carboy in a cool room, avoiding direct sunlight
    - Sunlight doesn't have a direct impact on mead (unlike beer), however it may raise the temperature, causing issues
    - Consistent temperature is important - being slightly "over" temperature is better than having large temperature swings (ex. avoid a room that goes from 52 to 62, instead choose one that stays close to 65)
2. 24 Hours after fermenting started, gently pour in ~1 gram of Fermaid-O
    - It is not crucial to be exact
    - It is a good idea to mix the nutrient in a small amount of warm water before pouring into the carboy. If you pour  the powder straight in, the chances are high there will be a reaction causing bubbling and spillage
3. Repeat step 2 at the 48 and 96 hour marks
4. Every day for the first 6 days, pick up the carboy and gently swirl it around. This will:
    - Keep yeast floating
    - Push some CO2 out (you should see additional bubbling in your airlock)
    - This can be done immediately prior to adding the nutrients
5. After day 6, you simply need to periodically check the airlock to ensure it still has appropriate liquid level

## Phase 5: Ferment Done?
1. Fermenting will continue for at least 2 - 4 weeks. If the bubbles in the airlock have slowed or stopped, it may be near complete
2. Pour a sample into a (sanitized) test tube, and then insert your (sanitized) hydrometer.
    - If your hydrometer measures under 1.000, fermention is complete
    - If it is above 1.000, write the value down (or take a photo), wait 4 - 5 days and re-measure. If you get the exact same reading, fermenting is complete
3. As long as your test tube and hydrometer were sanitized, you can pour your test sample back into the carboy  
  
  
*The next three Phases can be completed with no waiting in between*
## Phase 6: Racking and Stabilizing
1. Two days before racking, move your full carboy to the table you will do the racking at
    - This will allow any sediment shaken up to re-settle before racking
2. Sanitize your second carboy with StarSan, and allow the excess to drain
3. Crush a tablet of campden and put it into the empty carboy
4. Put 0.6 - 0.8 grams of Potassium Sorbate into the empty carboy
5. Using the (sanitized) racking cane, transfer the mead to the new carboy
    - Be sure to only pull liquid above the sediment (which is dead yeast)

## Phase 7: Backsweeten (and/or fruit)
If you do not want to sweet or add flavors, you may skip this entirely  
Adding fruits and spices can be tricky and difficult
1. Add your fruits, spices, or honey into your (cleaned, sanitized) carboy
2. Most fruits and spices will pull their flavor in 2 to 3 weeks
3. After you are happy with the flavor, rack a second to to a clean, sanitized carboy

## Phase 8: Clearing your Mead
Technically a Mead will "clear" completely on its own, over the course of months. We're gonna speed it up with some science
1. Simply follow the directions on Super-Kleer
2. If you are going to bottle, it is best to wait 7 days after putting Super-Kleer in
3. Depending on how much sediment is present, you may consider racking again after this step

## Congrats, you're done.
